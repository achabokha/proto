                            <h3>EMBILY FZ LLC TERMS OF USE</h3>
                            <p>By using this website (“Site”), registering for a Embily Account (“Account”), or using any of our other Embily Services, you (“you, your, or yourself”) are agreeing to accept and comply with the terms and conditions of use stated below (“Terms of Use”). You should read the entire Terms of Use carefully before you use this Site or any of the Embily Services. As used in this Terms of Use, “Embily” refers to the company Embily FZ LLC with registered address at Units 2201 & 2202, Level 22, Boulevard Plaza, Tower 2, Downtown Dubai, including, without limitation, its owners, directors, investors, employees or other related parties. Depending upon the context, “Embily” may also refer to the services, products, website, content or other materials (collectively, “Embily Services”) provided by Embily. The Service operated by Embily allows sellers (“Sellers”), to convert their digital assets and make payments and transactions with converted currencies. The Service operated by Embily also allows all registered users of the Service (“Members”) to:</p>
                            <p>Use digital assets for purchasing goods.</p>
                            <p>Depending on your country of residence, you may not be able to use all the functions of the Site. It is your responsibility to follow those rules and laws in your country of residence and/or country from which you access this Site and Services. As long as you agree to and comply with these Terms of Use, Embily grants to you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable and limited right to enter and use the Site and the Service. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THE TERMS OF USE AND CONDITIONS OUTLINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT ACCESS THIS SITE AND DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE. By opening an Account, you expressly represent and warrant:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>You have accepted these Terms; and</li>
                                <li>You are at least 18 years of age and have the full capacity to accept these Terms and enter into a transaction involving Digital Assets.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>RISKS</strong></p>
                            <p>The trading of goods and products, real or virtual, as well as virtual currencies involves significant risk. Prices can and do fluctuate on any given day. Due to such price fluctuations, you may increase or lose value in your assets at any given moment. Any assets – virtual or not – may be subject to large swings in value and may even become worthless. There is an inherent risk that losses will occur as a result of buying, selling or trading anything on a market. Digital asset trading also has special risks not generally shared with official currencies or goods or commodities or other assets in a market. Unlike most currencies, which are backed by governments or other legal entities, or by commodities such as gold or silver, cryptocurrency, a kind of digital asset, is a unique kind of "fiat" currency, backed by technology and trust. There is no central bank that can take corrective measure to protect the value of digital assets in a crisis or issue more cryptocurrency. Instead, digital cryptocurrency assets are as-yet autonomous and largely unregulated worldwide systems of currency firms and individuals. Traders put their trust in a digital, decentralised and partially anonymous system that relies on peer-to-peer networking and cryptography to maintain its integrity. Digital asset trading is probably susceptible to irrational (or rational) bubbles or loss of confidence, which could collapse demand relative to supply. For example, confidence might collapse in digital assets because of unexpected changes imposed by the software developers or others, a government crackdown, the creation of superior competing alternative currencies, or a deflationary or inflationary spiral. Confidence might also collapse because of technical problems: if the anonymity of the system is compromised, if money is lost or stolen, or if hackers or governments are able to prevent any transactions from settling. There may be additional risks that we have not foreseen or identified in our Terms of Use. You should carefully assess whether your financial situation and tolerance for risk are suitable for buying, selling or trading digital assets.</p>

The creation or use of Accounts without obtaining the prior express permission from Embily will result in the immediate suspension of all said Accounts, as well as all pending purchase/sale offers. Any attempt to do so or to assist others (Members or otherwise), or the distribution of instructions, software or tools for that purpose, will result in the Accounts of such Members being terminated. Termination is not the exclusive remedy for such a violation, and Embily may elect to take further action against you. You also are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account information, including your password, safeguarding your own Digital Assets, and for all activity including Transactions that are posted to your Account.

                            <p>ACCOUNT OPENING PROCEDURES.</p>

                            <p><strong>PROOF OF IDENTIFICATION:</strong></p>

                            <p>Individual</p>

                            <p>Residence address and mailing address if different (PO Box alone will not be acceptable)</p>

                            <p>Official issued identification number (e.g., passport number, social security number, employee identification number or individual taxpayer identification number)</p>

                            <p>Documents used in opening an account relationship must be verified prior to establishing the account. Verification of identity will require multi-factor authentication, layered security and other controls to ensure a meaningful user identity confirmation process based on account size or other factors.</p>

                            <p>The following are examples of verification methods the Company may use:</p>

                            <p>Obtaining proof of address, such as a copy of a utility bill or bank statement from the account holder.</p>

                            <p>The Company will diligently monitor transactions for suspicious activity. Transactions that are unusual will be carefully reviewed to determine if it appears that they make no apparent sense or appear to be for an unlawful purpose. Internal controls will be implemented so that an ongoing monitoring system is in place to detect such activity as it occurs. When such suspicious activity is detected, the Company will determine whether a filing with any law enforcement authority is necessary.</p>

                            <p>Suspicious activity can include more than just suspected money laundering attempts. Activity may be suspicious, and the Company may wish to make a filing with a law enforcement authority, even if no money is lost as a result of the transaction.</p>

                            <p>The Company will initially make the decision of whether a transaction is potentially suspicious. Once the Company has finished the review of the transaction details, he or she will consult with the Company’s senior management to make the decision as to whether the transaction meets the definition of suspicious transaction or activity and whether any filings with law enforcement authorities should be filed.</p>

                            <p>The Company will maintain a copy of the filing as well as all backup documentation. The fact that a filing has been made is confidential. No one, other than those involved in the investigation and reporting should be told of its existence. In no event should the parties involved in the suspicious activity be told of the filing. The Company may inform the Company’s Board of the filing and the underlying transaction.</p>

                            <p><strong>REPORTING REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>

                            <p>Reasonable procedures for maintaining records of the information used to verify a person’s name; address and other identifying information are required under this Policy. The following are required steps in the record keeping process:</p>
