        <p><strong>RISKS</strong></p>
        <p>The trading of goods and products, real or virtual, as well as virtual currencies involves significant risk. Prices can and do fluctuate on any given day. Due to such price fluctuations, you may increase or lose value in your assets at any given moment. Any assets – virtual or not – may be subject to large swings in value and may even become worthless. There is an inherent risk that losses will occur as a result of buying, selling or trading anything on a market. Digital asset trading also has special risks not generally shared with official currencies or goods or commodities or other assets in a market. Unlike most currencies, which are backed by governments or other legal entities, or by commodities such as gold or silver, cryptocurrency, a kind of digital asset, is a unique kind of "fiat" currency, backed by technology and trust. There is no central bank that can take corrective measure to protect the value of digital assets in a crisis or issue more cryptocurrency. Instead, digital cryptocurrency assets are as-yet autonomous and largely unregulated worldwide systems of currency firms and individuals. Traders put their trust in a digital, decentralised and partially anonymous system that relies on peer-to-peer networking and cryptography to maintain its integrity. Digital asset trading is probably susceptible to irrational (or rational) bubbles or loss of confidence, which could collapse demand relative to supply. For example, confidence might collapse in digital assets because of unexpected changes imposed by the software developers or others, a government crackdown, the creation of superior competing alternative currencies, or a deflationary or inflationary spiral. Confidence might also collapse because of technical problems: if the anonymity of the system is compromised, if money is lost or stolen, or if hackers or governments are able to prevent any transactions from settling. There may be additional risks that we have not foreseen or identified in our Terms of Use. You should carefully assess whether your financial situation and tolerance for risk are suitable for buying, selling or trading digital assets.</p>

        <p><strong>MAINTAINING YOUR ACCOUNT: OUR RULES</strong></p>
        <p>By registering with us, you agree to provide Embily with current, accurate, and complete information about yourself as prompted by the registration process, and to keep such information updated. You further agree that you will not use any Account other than your own, or access the Account of any other Member at any time, or assist others in obtaining unauthorised access. The creation or use of Accounts without obtaining the prior express permission from Embily will result in the immediate suspension of all said Accounts, as well as all pending purchase/sale offers. Any attempt to do so or to assist others (Members or otherwise), or the distribution of instructions, software or tools for that purpose, will result in the Accounts of such Members being terminated. Termination is not the exclusive remedy for such a violation, and Embily may elect to take further action against you. You also are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account information, including your password, safeguarding your own Digital Assets, and for all activity including Transactions that are posted to your Account. If there is suspicious activity related to your Account, we may, but are not obligated, to request additional information from you, including authenticating documents and to freeze any transactions pending our review. You are obligated to comply with these security requests or accept termination of your Account. You are required to notify Embily immediately of any unauthorised use of your Account or password, or any other breach of security by email addressed to services@embily.com.

The suspension of an Account shall not affect the payment of the commissions due for past Transactions. Upon termination, Members shall communicate a valid bank account to allow for the transfer of any currencies credited to their account. Said bank account shall be held by the Member. Digital Assets may be transferred to a valid bank account only after conversion into a currency. Embily shall transfer the currencies as soon as possible following the Member's request within the timeframes specified by Embily. Embily will send to you the credit balance of your Account, however, in circumstances, a number of intermediaries may be involved in an international payment and these or the beneficiary bank may deduct charges.
